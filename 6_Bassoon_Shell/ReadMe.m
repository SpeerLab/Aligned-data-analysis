%The code will be updated for gradient shell analysis. 
%The diameter of a CNS vesicle would be ~40nm. 

%In addition, we'll need to try interpolated vs. non-interpolate data. 
%The latter one will include some 3D information. 

%For PA and VFTZ, there were no vesicles from the active zone in 2 vesicle
%diameters, which will be 80nm. However, VFTZ could show up together with a
%SAZ in a same synapse at separated locations. So there could be
%subcluster-specific differences. 

%So the shell analysis will have gradient radius: 
%16nm - 32nm - 48nm - 64nm - 80nm. 
%The images could be interpolated vs. non-interpolated. 
%There should be subcluster specific analysis.
